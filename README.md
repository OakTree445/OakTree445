- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alex Rea
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in additive manufacturing
- ðŸŒ± I am an electrical enginnering student

  I am using this GitHub as a place to store and share my designs. Many are not fully finished but I will do my best to update the repository as I work on them!
I have currently designed and built 1 large CoreXY 3d printer with a build volume of 445x445x800 (XYZ) and am working on a 305x305x350 (XYZ) high temp toolchanging 3d printer.
The large COREXY is called "Beeg Printer" and the tool changer still needs a final name, but working name is "ChangeBot". 
  I have also designed a few car parts for older cars that are hard to purchace / ridiculously expensive due to their age. And finally, I have designed and created a couple
cosmetic items such as custom napkin rings for my Dad's wedding that I cast out of pewter after making a mold using a 3d printed master.
  When building  my newest printer I have been implementing a variety of techniques. The bed assembly is brazed aluminum plate, most of hte motion components are 3d printed, and carrying handles on the sides are sand cast out of aluminum.
